# Biome Scanner

Fork of @talonos2, Icedice, and @CannibalVox's code [here](https://github.com/CannibalVox/CavesToKingdoms)

This is just the Biome Scanner used upon the Jaded in Blightfall, separated into a different mod for maintenance.

## Building

Biome Scanner uses the new buildscript, so you should just be able to run
```
./gradlew setupDecompWorkspace
./gradlew build
```
